## 1.1 - 2015-19-12

Added the version 1.1 release. This version cleaned up the changelog.md nothing more. Its also because of people don't
like downloading version 1.0. We can now make those people happy with this release.

## 1.0 - 2015-19-12

This is version 1.0. I'm committing all over the place because i didn't add any tests yet. This is soon to change.
As with any software its better to wait for the 1.1 release.
